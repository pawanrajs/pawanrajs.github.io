Danish is the black sheep - a below average 23 year old in a family of high-achievers. And he is very very aware of it. Aisha is a 17 year old late bloomer who has always felt like an outsider and is still coming to grips with who she is becoming, as a woman and as a person. Events conspire to put Danish in the position of an unwilling conusellor for the unwilling student (Aisha) at school. And thus begins the journey of self-discovery, growth and of course, love, for both of them. There's a lot to like about \"Our Impossible Love\". It is easy to read. The language is uncomplicated and the story, even if a little cliched, moves along nimbly. First person narrative is a good choice because it makes the story personal. If you've been to school, you'll recognize and relate to teenage love, friendship, crushes, bullying, and the struggles of evolving and finding your identity through teenage years. If you've grown up with family, situations with parents, the (real and imagined) generation gap, filial love, sibling rivalry (and love) will make you choke up in a few places. In the course of portraying Aisha's growth, the author also touches upon important aspects in the context of Indian society. The role of women, the taboo that is sex, consent, homosexuality, bullying, rape. Done via the characters' voices, the author's thoughts are projected largely without being overly rambling, didactic or maudlin. You are allowed to supplement the characters' thoughts with your own experiences, and personally I like that. However, in some ways, this is a book that is difficult to contextualize. The setting is a school, and the characters are in school (or not too long after it). No doubt a lot as changed since I was in school. But in my school, things were a little more... staid. And we were a little more oblivious. There were no counsellors, rumours weren't this vicious, nerds were just ignored (i should know) instead of hated, and we didn't have a clue if any of our friends were gay. So Aisha's school and everything that happens seems a little too exciting and movie-like for me. Aisha herself alternates between a naive 12 year old, and a sage 35 year old far too easily, and far too quickly. Danish too, effortlessly switches between a 23 year old failure who cannot converse normally with the opposite sex and a confident, wise counsellor adult. Other characters (Aisha's brother, parents) also have these sudden context-switches or resolutions of their arcs, that yank you out of the mental space you are in. To my mind, this does a couple of things. For one, it impedes the character arc and breaks the immersion. But more importantly, it does a disservice to Datta's no doubt worthy intentions of exposing young readers to thorny societal issues. Raising these questions is of course necessary, but leaving things like homosexuality or rape half-discussed or explored only in passing, could be dangerous. It might engender conclusions that may be opposite of the ones intended. I am not young (and probably not who the book is intended for). Maybe I am reading a little too much into what is essentially a \"movie-script\" of a book. But I hope that if a teenager is reading the book, he finds time to discuss it with parents or peers, just to help them along in their journey. For me personally, the book has a good concept and perhaps a noble cause, but falls short on execution. 3/5 stars.","tags":"Reviews","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-our-impossible-love-durjoy-datta","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-our-impossible-love-durjoy-datta"},{"title":"Book Review: Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller","text":"Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller is the story of Willy Loman, an ageing salesman who can no longer keep it together. He tries to \"keep it together\" by being in denial. He denies the mediocrity and helplessness of his present - loudly and angrily - using his old \"glories\" as a means to escape the evidence all around him. He denies the mistakes he made that got him here by rationalizing them away. He denies help from friends by jealously ignoring their successes. He denies himself by ignoring what makes him happy - hanging on instead to his idea of the American Dream - that being well-liked is the key to success. He abdicates the responsibility of being a father to be liked. He denies that he isn't well-liked, by reminiscing about times when he was moderately successful, and idolized by his handsome sons Biff and Happy. Who themselves continue to use the trick taught to them by their father, of living in denial and thinking the present away . They too, are dissatisfied with their lives but acknowledge it only partially at best. And Willy's wife Linda - who knows that the ugliness of reality will catch up with Willy and devastate him, tries her best to protect her husband from it as long as she can. Even though it was written in 1949, the play feels remarkably current. The idea of the American Dream - of \"hustling to making it\", is timeless. The proposition that success comes to those that are well-liked seems extremely pertinent in today's age of internet influencers. The failed struggle to succeed, the feeling of pedaling furiously to stay where you are, the obstinate refusal to accept failure are all modern malaises too. And the relationships among the Loman family will be found being played out in many a home today. Reading this book hurt. And it will probably hurt you too. It will take you back to times when you felt like a failure, felt abandoned, or were filled with overwhelming regret at a bad decision you made. It will make you deliberate upon your relationships with your family and loved ones. It will get you to reflect on your definition of success, happiness, family and self-worth. It might surface emotions that you might not want to deal with. I don't think I can fully convey the complexity and depth of this short play in this review. Spend an hour to read it for yourself, especially if you're over the age of 30. Let the words take your mind where they will. Maybe you'll hate it. But you won't regret having read it 4/5 stars.","tags":"Reviews","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-death-of-a-salesman-arthur-miller","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-death-of-a-salesman-arthur-miller"},{"title":"Book Review: Stardust by Neil Gaiman","text":"Stardust by Neil Gaiman is the story of a half-blood Tristan, the result of a tryst between a simpleton in the village of Wall and a Faerie girl from the realms beyond. Desirous of Victoria Forester, young Tristan sets out on a perilous journey beyond the wall to the magical land of Faerie, to find her a falling star. But, Tristan discovers, this isn't a simple task. And in the course of accomplishing what he set out to do - he also discovers himself. And love. Stardust is a fairy tale for adults. Well at least PG-16. There are fairies, gnomes, magicians, and witches engaged in acts of kindness, cruelty, lust and love with their own respective agendas. The writing feels old-timey, but language is modern. The prose is tight - no superfluous witticisms, no self-indulgent embellishments. A welcome change from the last book I reviewed. . And yet, the world of Faerie doesn't feel incomplete or underdeveloped. There is just enough detail to draw you in without constraining your imagination. The characters are all active, dynamic, and have reasons for doing what they do. The story flows easily and naturally, like a quiet river. Tributaries come and meet the river, merging into the main story, sometimes peacefully, and at other times noisily. And the river continues its course, meandering pleasantly towards its final destination. It follows the path known and well understood. If one were to nitpick, one could say that the plot moves forward \"conveniently\". Help appears exactly where it is needed, without the characters having to go through a phase of metamorphosis. Tristan Thorn's coming of age is equally effortless, and occurs naturally. He goes from a \"naive, infatuated teenager\" to \"a mature grown up\" just as a matter of course. Romance too, just \"happens\". However, I think this is by design. This isn't meant to be a complex or unpredictable book. It isn't a book written to tax your emotions. It is a book to take you on a journey while leaving you free to enjoy it however you want. You could curl up with the book, read the story, and come away from it without feeling tired or burdened. Stardust is a well-told coming of age meets a children's fairy-tale packaged for adult reading. It is book comfort-food. It was fun, non-serious literature and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 4/5 stars.","tags":"Reviews","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-stardust-neil-gaiman","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-stardust-neil-gaiman"},{"title":"Book Review: Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts","text":"Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts is a first person narration by Lin, an Australian fugitive who escapes to Mumbai, where adventures happen. Magical, unbelievable, grandiose Bollywood-movie adventures. In the book, he escapes from Australian prison to Bombay, becomes a street thug, lives and runs a health clinic in the slums, goes to prison in India, joins the mafia, and even fights alongside the Mujahideen in Afghanistan. And in true Bollywood style, there's love, betrayal, anger, drama, violence, sex, singing and dancing in good measure. A solid 900 pages of it, in fact. Now, I don't have a problem with ambitious stories with a large scope. For example, this is one of my favourite books . Nor do I have a problem with books that are full of wordplay, metaphors and lyrical prose . The problem I do have is that descriptive, metaphorical prose comes at the expense of the important bits like story progression, character development and pacing. I understand that descriptions are there to immerse you into, what might be for a lot of readers, a foreign world. However, too many metaphors / similes are just self-indulgent, trying to demonstrate how \"clever\" the author is, while actually being mediocre, and achieving nothing substantial. Some turns of phrase are just ... cringy. Descriptions of Mumbai seem exaggerated towards stereotypical. Places and characters feel like they've been written to pander to a very specific idea of of India and Indians, that might be held by folks who've not visited or interacted with the country or its people. Most of the characters are flatter than the sheet of paper they're written on. They're put in a time and place, and they hardly ever change. And the main one - Lin - is probably one of the least likeable protagonists ever. He either has a giant hero complex or comes across as incredibly vain while trying really hard to come across as \"wise\" and \"nice\". Every little anecdote that happens to him is followed by a (mostly) trite philosophical reflection. Every. single. one. All terrible things does, he kinda-sorta rationalizes badly. Every character he meets, he either just \"likes\" or \"dislikes\" - and we don't know why. The name Shantaram gets relegated to a footnote. IT IS THE TITLE OF THE BOOK FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE! Honestly, there are 900 pages available to the author. And the idea of a foreigner coming to India, and becoming \"Indian\" has so much scope for interesting interactions. Give me backstories, give me emotional upheaval, give me solid reasons to root for the characters. Make it compelling. We get very little of that. People just fall into things occurring, or, worse still, have a flimsy pseudo-philosophical justifications to do \"the wrong thing for the right reasons.\" Not everything is like that of course - some observations about people living in less than ideal conditions ring true. There are nuggets about freedom, love & morality that I liked. Roberts obviously is clever, and has the talent to write well. Parts 4 and 5 in particular, read like a thrilling adventure without the focus on over-embellished prose and philosophical musings. And maybe this would've been better as a series of short stories, or even a 500 page book written more in the style of Parts 4/5. But in its current form - it was hard to find a central theme or focus for the book. It felt a bit try-hard, maybe written for a movie deal. And made for uncompelling, even tedious reading. It felt like work. 2/5 stars.","tags":"Reviews","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-shantaram-gregory-david-roberts","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-shantaram-gregory-david-roberts"},{"title":"Book Review: The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger","text":"The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger is a love story of Henry and Clare. Henry suffers from a genetic disorder that causes him to time-travel unpredictably, and his artist wife Clare suffers... well she suffers most of the consequences of this unpredictability. The plot is extremely simple per se. Boy meets girl, boy gets to know girl, they become boyfriend girlfriend, do boyfriend-girlfriend stuff, boy marries girl, they do husband-wife stuff, boy dies. Except this sequence is complicated by a singular plot device: temporal disarticulation of the boy. And the disarticulation is used to articulate many themes: chief among them being a depiction of enduring love. Niffenegger's portrayal of enduring love is Clare - an anchor, a safe harbor that you can return to no matter how fucked everything gets. Her love waits patiently, and accepts unconditionally. In the Henry and Clare world love overcomes all obstacles, even death. Apparently, a driving force while Niffenegger was writing the book was her need to create her ideal love (after a string of failed relationships). And she certainly goes a fair ways in indulging herself. Other than that, I was compelled to reflect on how time affects and constrains us. On the one hand, there are indications of just how much reliance we place on temporal context and how unmoored we are without it. On the other, it also occurred to me, how living chronologically could be... well... boring . Henry's time-travels, his reaction to it, and the difficulties it puts him and others in his life also raise questions of the need to feel in control, and have an illusion of choice even if everything is deterministic - just to avoid falling into depression. Henry's thought about running, his insistence on not revealing the future, and Clare's frustrations during the house-hunt are just some examples of events that force you to think. In raising these ideas, Niffenegger's writing shows a lot of promise. The story is fairly tightly woven, considering time travel is the central device for breaking the linearity. Foreshadowing future events leads, for the most part, to satisfying payoffs. And the author's descriptive writing style serves to ground the reader in the here and now when they are unceremoniously dumped into a different temporal location. That being said, descriptions ARE excessive. Even accounting for the need for grounding, it feels unnecessary to tell me for the nth time that Henry is naked and needs to find clothes. Or the contents of Henry and Clare's grocery shopping. Or the minutiae of paper-making. These descriptions slow everything down, and take the space that could've been better utilized to explore, for instance Henry's feelings about time-travel, his growth due to it, reactions of his \"friends and family\" to it, or in general defining character arcs and character growth. Instead, we get a lot of ... acceptance. Henry rapidly adjusts to \"his problem\", and proceeds to use time traveling as an excuse to drink, get high and get into trouble - when, ironically, stress is what makes him time travel in the first place. He is mostly self-centered and only towards the later part of the book comes to appreciate Clare as his anchor while he is unmoored in time. Clare at age six and age 85 is pretty much the same. Her outlook is accepting of Henry and her, and very fatalistic with only the occasional hints at her frustration, that goes unaddressed (for e.g. the househunt that she tries to go at alone, or when she sleeps with Gomez). Henry's friends and colleagues (Gomez, Ben, his library colleagues) just accept that he is weird / a time-traveler. Other characters are mostly cardboard cutouts and stereotypical - an Asian who can't speak good English, a posh Downton Abbey family, complete with a crazy mom, men fond of hunting, and servants. They are just there. What would've been nice is probing into their reactions to Henry's condition, their own adjustments and growth to it, and a story to fill in the gaps instead of using time travel to conveniently move the story forward, and using words to describe \"skits\". Time travel is fascinating and raises a ton of questions. In this book, time travel is just a crutch to prop up a love story. Which is fine, if you like the idea of forever-after love and love stories. If you find joy in descriptive writing in general, you'll get your fix. But if you, like me, go into it intrigued by a possible exploration of the themes of time travel, you might be left a little wanting. You might even find the book 100 pages too long. To be clear, it isn't a terrible book. But it is one I'd put firmly in the category of \"just alright\". 3/5 stars.","tags":"Reviews","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-the-time-travelers-wife-audrey-niffenegger","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-the-time-travelers-wife-audrey-niffenegger"},{"title":"Spring Cleaning","text":"\"It's been a while...\" \"Too many of our conversations begin that way.\" \"I am aware.\" \"So, what have you been up to?\" \"Oh, this and that.\" \"That's... forthcoming.\" \"You are my subconscious you know.

However, securing these environments remains a challenge with 75% of IT professionals citing it as their top concern that restricts their organization's migration to public cloud. Traditional security deployment options do not work well with applications hosted on public clouds. Most Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) operate on a shared responsibility model in which the CSP is responsible for security of the cloud infrastructure, while you as consumers are responsible for security in the cloud. As cloud infrastructure becomes more secure, the focus is shifting increasingly to identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities within the customer applications and data on the cloud. Complexity and distributed nature of cloud and cloud applications further creates \"Shadow IT\" – increasing the attack surface and providing opportunities for attackers to hide. Effective application security in cloud generation, thus requires a new mentality and new approaches that enable the performance organizations need as well as addresses security risks, beyond perimeter security. The security focus in cloud environments is on controlling access, protecting services and systems within the cloud, and maintaining confidentiality and integrity of your data in the cloud. Additionally, you need a well-defined and practiced process for responding to security incidents not just to achieve business objectives and preventing loss, but also to comply with regulatory obligations. Architecting security for cloud relies on updating your people, modifying the IT processes and refreshing the technology stack based on the below principles and best practices: 1. Implement a Strong Identity and Access Management foundation Identity and Access Management are key parts of an information security program, ensuring that only authorized and authenticated users are able to access your resources, and only in the manner that you intend. The general security principle to follow is to implement the principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each interaction with your cloud resources. Specific steps you could take are: Credentialing and authenticating users AND programs: Credentials must be granted to users, as well as programs that use APIs to call cloud services, and should not be shared between any user or system. Best practices including password requirements and enforced multi-factor authentication should be the standard. Programmatic access should be performed using short-duration and limited-privilege credentials like tokens and keys. This reduces the likelihood of a large scale compromise if one of the programs, or one of the elements of a multifactor authentication chain is breached. Identifying Access Rights and Authorization: The first step in defining access rights is to define the organizational hierarchy and principals (users, groups, and roles) with clear delineation of assets, services and data required. Granular policies can then be built aligned with these principles. Each role, as well as cloud storage/content delivery service may have its own access policies – to properly secure access not just by users but also by programs Enforcing access rights and authorization: may best be done via roles, identity federation or temporary credentials that attach to groups and policies defined, to limit access only to what is necessary, and only for however long it is required. 2. Enable traceability through Detective Controls Detective controls are an essential part of the governance framework, and can be used to monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time to identify potential security threats or incidents. They support not just security, but also feed into application quality and compliance processes. They help to analyze, identify and predict anomalous activity. Most CSPs provide service level logging and metrics, as well as alerting facilities (when thresholds are crossed) for services they expose. You should either use these services to define logging levels, log retention lifecycle (including where the data will be preserved and archived). You can use these and analyze logs to: Establish operational baselines Gain visibility on events and identify security events and potential threats Audit to ensure that policies are calibrated as well as enforced correctly Fulfill regulatory or legal requirements. A periodic cloud security audit of your environment will ensure that you recheck for any configuration errors, sharing risks, files containing sensitive information, and more, that could creep into your environment. 3. Apply security at all layers of the infrastructure Rather than just focusing on protection of a single outer layer (perimeter security), cloud security requires a defense-in-depth approach with other security controls. Any security model for the cloud should focus on: Protecting the perimeter with firewalls and packet inspection tools Protecting the network from threats internal and external to it Protecting compute resources such as APIs, servers, and database services in the cloud Protecting data (more on this later) As with traditional security, enforcing boundary protection, monitoring points of ingress and egress, and comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting are still essential to effective information security. Additionally, protecting the network in the cloud starts with creating a Private Cloud, and appropriately defining the topology – including gateways, routing tables and private and public subnets. Additional Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) and security groups can be deployed to provide multiple layers of protection to the network as well as compute resources. Device policies may have to be enforced to combat the entropy introduced into the network by increasing trend of BYOD and work-from-home situations Developing golden images, or using the CSP marketplace to procure them is another way to avoid creating new attack surfaces, as new instances of services in the cloud can automatically be protected when they are launched. 4. Protect your Data in the cloud, in transit and at rest Data is the single most important area of security in the cloud. Usually, the CSP has no ownership of data beyond providing resilient storage, leaving the security almost entirely in your hands. In addition, data breaches invite not only operational hazards, but also have compliance, legal and reputational ramifications. Before establishing any architectural practices, it is important to classify data to categorize it based on sensitivity. You can then use storage policies, organizational design and network segregation to isolate data and limit access. Regulatory requirements like GDPR may necessitate storage of data in specific regions. It is important to understand how your CSP deals with data across their infrastructure to ensure your operational needs are met. Encryption should be used to protect data in transit (using TLS) and at rest (using keys), and render it unintelligible to unauthorized access. Most CSPs will provide tools to facilitate encryption: Facility to encryption file storage and databases at rest Services to manage keys used to encrypt data. Logging of data / file access requests and changes Versioning, can also be used as part of the larger data lifecycle management process, to protect against accidental overwrites, deletes, and similar harm. As part of your design, create mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This reduces the risk of loss or modification and human error when handling sensitive data. 5. Automate security best practices Given the distributed nature of cloud, automation is paramount in cloud security. Automated software-based security mechanisms enhance the ability to scale rapidly without increasing costs. It also reduces chances of errors as new resources and users are added to your organization, and helps to tackle \"shadow IT\" that more and more security organizations must contend with. Creating and implementing controls that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates, which can then be used to enforce policies is a key tenet of cloud implementation. This could be in the form of: Integrated logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action. Creating hardened machine images which can be automatically used to spin up new compute instances Cleaning up access and ids as people and assets leave the organization Automating alerts based on deviation from established operating baselines Automated audits of your configuration to provide ongoing information into the security health of your cloud applications. 6. Setup an Incident Response Process to prepare for security events Despite your best efforts, and mature preventive and detective controls, security incidents will occur. It is important to update your incident management process to align with your move to cloud. It is important to have the ability to quickly assemble the InfoSec team, grant them access for incident analysis, as well as isolate affected compute resources. Putting in place the tools, automation and processes ahead of a security incident, then routinely practicing incident response through game days, will help you ensure that your architecture can accommodate timely investigation and recovery while minimizing the potential disruption to your organization. Some examples of such tools are: Detailed Logging for important files and access changes, or capturing of forensic data when incidents are detected Provisioning clean-room environments for forensics using automated templates Alerts and triggers that can respond automatically through use of APIs In Conclusion These general principles provide a starting point to think about security in the cloud. Breaking down these principles into further actions that apply to users across IT, management and infrastructure teams can make the transition to cloud seamless. Furthermore, this shift in mindset from the traditional security model to a more distributed model requires reeducating not just the security team but the entire organization. This training in addition to an action plan to implement the principles can ensure security isn't an afterthought but part of the culture in this new paradigm.","tags":"Technology","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/cloud-application-security-best-practices","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/cloud-application-security-best-practices"},{"title":"Building My Static Site with Pelican","text":"What are we even talking about? In a traditional setup, a request recieved by the web-server (like NGINX) is forwarded to the Content Management System (CMS, like Wordpress). The CMS uses a number of templates, and data from a site database to build an HTML page specific to the request, and return to the user. This allows specifying dynamic behaviours based on user inputs. A static site, by contrast, is a combination of HTML, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript (for dynamic behaviour on the client), stored as simple files and served directly by a web-server or content delivery network. So why a static site? Low Complexity aka I get confused easily Traditional CMS based webhosting requires, in addition to a webserver, a CMS to create HTML pages, plugins to provide functionality, knowledge of a coding language, and a database for the CMS. By contrast, a static site is just a collection of HTML pages, JavaScript and CSS on a webserver - way less for my brain to comprehend and be confused by. Low Cost aka I am cheap Services like S3 or GitHub Pages make hosting costs practically free for low traffic sites (besides the cost of buying a domain). I chose Github Pages for my site, which means no money spent to serve the three people who visit my site. Maintainability aka I am lazy The content of a static website is stored as a collection of marked up text files. This means backups are as easy as a source-control system (yay Github!). Updating the content is as simple as firing up a text editor. Bulk changes and searches within the content are easy. And it is easy to convert from markdown to a different format. All this in addition to avoiding maintenance of the database, CMS and server. Security aka I am paranoid Every out of date plugin, (esp. third party plugins), unpatched database and server is a potential attack surface . Code that I write is probably only going to increase points of infiltration. And I don't want your data, or mine, exposed to the world. Speed aka I am impatient Serving a static site is extremely fast because all the web server needs to do is return a file. Site optimization (minification, image optimizations etc) can be performed before deploying, to further reduce bandwidth needs (something I will explore later in the series). A CMS must build pages from scratch using content from the database. Plugins add additional time to this operation. A Project aka I want to be cool I was looking for a project to combine a bunch of concepts which I think I will need going forward, and having a website that I can futz around with to be cool seemed like fun. Okay, okay.. So? So.. enter Pelican my Static Site Generator (SSG) of choice. SSG? A Static Site Generator (SSG) is an environment / platform that combines content written in a markup language (e.g Markdown) with pre-created templates (written with a templating engine like Jinja), to produce HTML/CSS/JS that can be served up. SSGs are an alternative to the traditional CMS in that once you build the scaffolding that is the theme of your site - all you worry about is the content. Popular static site generators include Jekyll (Ruby) , Pelican (Python) , Hugo (Go) and Metalsmith (JS) — see StaticGen for many more options. I chose Pelican because: It is written in Python which I wanted to get more familiar with. It uses Jinja2 for templating - which I am at least vaguely aware of how to use. It supports content written in Markdown which I use to write content. There are enough plugins to get my site most of the way there in terms of functionality I want. Took me a while to figure out what goes where - but Pelican has decent documentation, and now here we are. What I learned Well, besides brushing up on HTML, CSS, and creating a project in Python, there are a few things I got from the experience. While SSGs take away most the drudgery of hand-coded static sites, they are not for everyone. If you are NOT technically minded, and can't be bothered to trawl through StackOverflow while hating yourself for why a specific plugin doesn't work or why your site won't deploy - perhaps look at Wordpress. It takes way longer to port a theme over to Pelican than you would think. It's fun (I think), but budget time. There are plenty of pre-made themes to choose from, no doubt - but getting things \"just so\", especially with plugins - is time consuming. We take a lot of things a CMS provide (forms, comments, search, logins) for granted. Conversely, we also overrate the need for some of those things. For me, the challenge was fun, and gave me a chance to work my long disused technical muscle, learn a few tricks and refresh some old ones. Now that I have a blog I poured my sweat and tears into, maybe I'll even write more!","tags":"Technology","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/static-site-pelican-what-is-going-on","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/static-site-pelican-what-is-going-on"},{"title":"Happy New Year?","text":"\"Happy New Year!\" \"It's been a while.\" \"You're supposed to say Happy New Year to you too.

You do not know what it is. You cannot pinpoint it. You try to turn the dial to bring into sharp focus the spectrum of emotions so you can hear them clearly - but find only vague incoherent static. The tuning mechanism of your life-radio is broken; you cannot tune out the static. It's not a sharp pain. It's a dull, undefined general feeling of malaise and unease. It's not isolated or diagnosed to a particular cause. It's just there - pervading your general life experience. Like that persistent irritation which will not go away no matter how many times you clear your throat. Like that headache which doesn't stop you in your tracks, but doesn't let you ignore it either. So you keep going about your daily routine. And there is no problem as such. But you frown when you wake up in the morning, as you have to make an effort to throw off the covers and drag yourself out of bed. You stare for a few seconds too long, first at the wall as you sit up on the bed trying to will yourself off it, then at the stream of water emerging out of the faucet in the bathroom, avoiding looking at yourself in the mirror when you brush. You don't even really want to brush your teeth, but you do. You forego the shave, however - that one day old black stubble is like ... glitter. It's there, betraying you to the world if they care to look closely. You iron your shirt, but not your trousers. Your shoes stay unpolished. It's just not a day for shiny shoes. Not today. You walk to work, but take a longer route. If someone saw you, they would see a man alternatively staring off into the distance, and intently staring at the asphalt he is walking on, almost like he is counting the number of cracks on the road. You linger around at the cart serving coffee outside your office building - staring at the wisps of white smoke emerging out of the blackness of the liquid, but unlike other days - you do not smell the coffee. It is not the day for such pleasures. Not today. You walk up to your office, passing by the usual hordes of office-humanity - trying to tune out the static that is a confusion of spoken words, sighs patient and impatient, clacking shoes, dinging elevators and ringing telephones. Today everything is a little blurred. The whites are a little more yellow than white, the greys are a tiny bit greyer than usual. Your smile at the receptionist is a tiny bit colder. Your response to your boss' greeting is a tiny bit delayed, as he catches up to you on the way to elevator. You are a tiny bit miffed that you would be forced to share the elevator with another person. Just for today, you wanted the 10 second journey up to floor 23 to be in solitude. Maybe, this is good, the small talk is what stops you from falling deeper into the hole, the edge of which you are teetering on. You are miffed anyway. You're not ready for small talk. Not today. You walk past the mahogany door, past the hospital-like sterile sameness of cubicles, the green carpet, the grey cubicles with frosted glass, and the grey frosted people inside. You don't even say good morning to your colleague who looks at you with expectant eyes - wanting - you know - to talk about the incredible football game last night. Not today. Not today. You hurry past it all to your own cubicle right in the middle of this row of cubicles. Your special place in the sea of corporate sameness, housing replaceable, expendable faceless, nameless cogs in the machine. They are all the same. Everything is all the same. Different. But same. It is this sameness, isn't it? It this why you feel like a screw that is drilled in ever so slightly off center? A screw that will do the job, but is not just so? Is this what is bothering you? The thought crosses your mind, flitting across the surface like a pond-skater, creating tiny ripples. But you don't pursue it. This thought will have to wait. You cannot give it your attention.

Not today.","tags":"Scribbles","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/not-today","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/not-today"},{"title":"Growing up.","text":"It's been an interesting three months... My folks came to visit me, here in the States. While my father had been to the USA before, it was a first for mom. I saw them after a year, so that was nice. We visited a few places, so that was nice too. I got good homecooked food, which I duly stuffed myself with, and put on all those pounds I shed while I was training for the half-marathon (I think you're growing old when the deliciousness of mom's food starts competing with the need to \"watch your weight\"... Not sure how I feel about that). We took a trip together, the three of us, and *that* was really nice... I've been working for a decade now. I've been living independently, by myself, for most of that time. However, all this while, going home, meant going back to a place where there's someone to take care of you.. This time, though, it really felt the other way round. It felt like I had to take care of my folks. I had to be responsible for them. This is not to say that my parents couldn't do anything without me, because really, they are more than capable of taking care of themselves. However, it felt like they depended on me for a lot of things. And honestly, it was a lovely feeling to just be able to take care of the two people who've spent more than half their life, taking care of you. I sure as hell wasn't perfect doing it, and frankly, I think there's a lot of things I could do better (perhaps a post for another day). But it felt nice to finally be able to repay, even if in an infinitesimally small way, that kindness my parents have showered on me. It felt great to realize that you are someone who is capable and willing enough to do that. I felt like I had finally grown up. So, thank you mom, dad, for being who you were and are. I love you.

Apparently, Facebook played around with newsfeeds to make them more positive / negative. They were trying to determine if mood of the timeline affects the mood of the user. Evidently it does. Predictably, the pitchforks have come out at the supposed audacity of Facebook to manipulate people like that. I am not completely sure what I feel about it, because I haven't really given it a whole lot of thought. But there are a lot of different aspects to this story, that I am not sure how to reconcile... Besides, thinking takes time, which I have limited of. And it's not like you pay me for high-quality journalism. So, dear reader, I am just going to subject you to a laundry list of the initial unstructured mess that is my brain, on the subject: I am scared... Are we really sheeple, people? Does the mood of a series of posts on Facebook really cause our mood to be changed? Are we THAT easily manipulated? As a corollary, how much misplaced confidence do we have in ourselves, that we walk through life thinking that we are immune to the ways of the world, when all it takes to influence us are a few written words on the screen? How does this help Facebook? Will Facebook try now, to be \"your happy place\" ? Is Facebook's business model going to be to keep you happy, so that you keep coming back. I wrote a post, earlier, on the \"Like\" button . Is that just an extension of the \"keep people happy\" philosophy? Will this philosophy work for Facebook? Or is it going to backfire for them, spectacularly? At what point will the constant stream of \"happiness\" attributed to others, start making us jealous and negative instead of happy, as intended, so we \"flip the tables\" so to speak, and never return to Facebook again? Are we increasingly becoming swathes of data, in the eyes of these companies that have our personal information? At what point is the company obligated (if at all) to view us as human beings, and consider that manipulation of our feelings is not \"just another experiment\" ? On the other hand, what cause do we have for outrage? Facebook never promised that we will see the truth. They provide us one way to view our relationships and they've never said it is the truth. Besides, A/B testing is a reality for most internet companies. Isn't this just another form of A/B testing? Why, then, do we expect to be told about it? If Facebook as a service, has a goal of seeing us happy, then isn't Facebook within its rights to make changes to it's \"product\" to gauge customer reaction? Do we have a right to demand that we be told about it? What is the unwritten set of expectations that Facebook is fulfilling, and that we expect them to fulfil? At what point do the \"ethics of humankind\" supercede the \"nature of Facebook's business\"? Are people just angry because we're scared of how easily we are manipulated? Do we see this as an invasion of privacy (which I don't think it is)? Are we just mad at Facebook because we don't like being guinea pigs without knowing about it? Does it warrant this amount of outrage? We don't really think of all the ramifications of giving up our personal data and information to services as long as we get some value out of it. Every new shiny feature on Google of Facebook comes at the cost of our information. Privacy, in this day and age, is just dead. Why then, should it matter at all what Facebook does? Is this indicative of the general distrust of Facebook vis-a-vis other large tech companies? I mean, I doubt there would've been such a big hue-and-cry if Google had done this... If this is indeed how Facebook can influence us, how much about our relationships is defined by Facebook? If Facebook doesn't show me status updates by certain people or businesses, how does that impact my actual relationship with them? Do I forget about some people because I never see updates? If so, how much power does Facebook really have over not only individuals, but also groups and indeed, corporations (by dint of wielding this power over individuals)? I think I'm a little bemused, and quite a bit scared... What do you think?","tags":"Technology","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/the-facebook-experiment","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/the-facebook-experiment"},{"title":"To Like or Not to Like...","text":"I've been getting back on to social media after a fairly long hiatus. And most social media services have changed a little bit in that time. What hasn't changed however, is how stuff get's shared around these places. Google has +1, Tumblr has \"reblogging\", Twitter has \"retweet\" and Facebook has the \"like\"... And they rely on these nifty sharing mechanisms to decide what you see.. what bubbles to the top, so to speak. Out of the four, however, only Facebook has something that is a known word with a known meaning. And that makes things interesting... Linguistically speaking, liking something is to inherently tag it as \"good\". In Facebook's context therefore, there's likely to be a cognitive bias towards \"liking\" only stuff that is actually worth liking. That means, that status update someone made about cancer, or losing a loved one, or losing their dog isn't going to get \"likes\" . and is therefore not really going to be on your timeline for a long time. On other platforms, it's easier for those kind of things to bubble up, A +1, or a reblog isn't as \"emotional\" ... I wonder which is better? Personally, I think a true representation of what your friends are interested in is served by something like +1, or \"Share\" or \"Retweet\" or \"Reblog\" because it doesn't have a positive or negative connotation attached to it. It just indicates your \"support\" toward the content. With like , however, you're likely to not get a balanced picture. Is this a flaw, then, on Facebook's part? Did they miss an opportunity to be \"truer\" to the world? Or is \"like\" by design and they WANT only other people's happiness to show through in your timelines, because they know that's what we want to see? Is Facebook banking on the fact that a lot of us are voyeurs who live through others - either sharing in people's happiness, or being jealous of it.. which is why we keep coming back to Facebook? Or is \"Like\" just such a \"brand\" in itself now, that changing it to \"Share\" or \"Support\" just doesn't make any sense any more?

It is The Bible, but without (most of) the \"religious stuff\". What it does is recount the stories in the Bible in short 10-12 page chapters. And as I read, I realize that as a story, the Bible is quite interesting. And in that, it is not alone. The Quran, at its heart, is a story. The Bhagawad Gita, is just a small part of an epic called the Mahabharata. And most religions are underpinned stories about key figures and their deeds. And that says something about the power of stories. Most of what we remember has a good story behind it. A good movie, a good book, an incident you remember in vivid detail - there's a good story behind it. Want to preach - Tell a story. The best adverts - tell a story. A successful sales proposal - dig a little deeper, and you'll find that it chronicles a journey, draws a picture, tells a story. Customer satisfaction, brand recognition, are all about stories. Have you ever got tips on how to improve your memory? Chances are you've been told to connect disparate elements together with the wackiest story imaginable for the strongest recall. Why? Maybe the human brain likes to fill in the blanks between disparate facts. Maybe connections between neurons are analogous to connections between facts. Maybe it's that and the fact that human brains are the best pattern-recognition machines. If a certain group of \"connected pieces\" in a story are similar to something that we've experienced before, the brain just groups them together and invokes similar feelings to what we've previously experienced, making the feeling stronger. Plain simple facts are forgotten. A story endures. And the best stories reinforce already existing emotional structures, enhance experiences. They need an \"investment\" from the consumer of the story, so they feel a part of it. But as we move towards a world with limited attention spans and overload of stimuli, the window of this \"investment\" becomes shorter and shorter. What we end up with is a world of instant gratification - one that does not allow time to build \"connections\", the one that isn't built to endure. I wonder if the world seems a lot more ephemeral, the pace of change so fast, BECAUSE there is no time to stop and listen to stories. I wonder if life seems \"incomplete\" because we're not part of a story or narrative - living life instead, as a series of transactions. I wonder if the lack of stories is what has caused this to happen. Perhaps, what the world needs, is more connections, in more ways than one.","tags":"Scribbles","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/the-power-of-stories","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/the-power-of-stories"},{"title":"I Want to Talk to You...","text":"I want to talk to you.

I see you trying to tell me things that I don't understand because they cannot leap across the vast emptiness between us.

Michener","text":"The Source by James A. Michener Uses the background of an archaeological dig, to chronicle the rise of religion (specifically Judaism) from prehistory (30000 yrs ago), to the modern state of Israel (till 1960s, when the book was written). Defines the relationship of Judaism, with other derivative religions - Christianity and Islam. The book moves and skips in periods of centuries, Each chapter defines an important period in the history of religion, and is based on the levels uncovered during the dig, by the archaeologists. It chronicles the adventures of the members (descendants) of a single family (of Ur) starting from the first shreds of civilization. It's a long read (1000 pages), but doesn't get boring. Written in simple language, without being too judgmental about anything that happened during the time (Except towards the end, when it turns decidedly pro-Zionist). Each chapter relates modern attitudes (through conversations within the group at the archaeological dig) with the historical perspective and precedent of why the attitude prevails. Michener, while speculating on where the future might hold for Israel and Jews, doesn't burden the book with his judgments, or force them on us, and largely sticks to the relating what happened. While the stories ARE fictional, the book is incredibly well researched insofar as the major events of times are concerned, and the generally accepted narrative of history. If you do not know about Judaism, and it's rise, and the attitudes it signifies, and like reading about the history of Judaism and Christianity, and history in general, give it a whirl, and it won't disappoint. It's a wonderful romp through a large swath of time, and definitely better than reading dry academic records of the time. All you must do, is keep reminding yourself, a lot of it is fiction. Because it is very easy to believe a lot of those stories actually happened! So, if historical fiction and the history of religions interests you (like it does me), I recommend it wholeheartedly. You won't be disappointed, as long as the book is. Just remember, it *is* fiction. Or read it as a collection of tales set in different historical times :) My rating: Beautifully done. 4 of 5 stars","tags":"Reviews","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-the-source-james-michener","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-the-source-james-michener"},{"title":"Nuclear Power","text":"In the beginning there was just, the word...

They made them more and more sophisticated, bigger, \"badder\" as the clamour against them increased... There was also this set of people who got nostalgic about the world before nuclear power. Presumably these were the set of people that also got nostalgic about the world before rapid industrialization (when that happened) and longed to go back to the time when the earth was flat. They advocated letting the U-235 disintegrate in peace. There were demonstrations, speeches, conventions and pamphlets. People got confused, divided... And all this while, the bomb-makers made bombs... the reactor-makers made reactors, they won the preeminent science-prizes... And there continued to be demonstrations, pamphlets, speeches, conventions and peace-marches...","tags":"Scribbles","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/nuclear-power","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/nuclear-power"},{"title":"This way and That...","text":"So, imagine this. You're walking on this road. Just you. All alone. You cannot turn back. You cannot sit down. You have nowhere else to go. You have nowhere to turn. And so, you must walk the direction you're walking in. And then you see a vehicle coming at you. You move out of the way. As you continue on, you see another. And another. And yet another. And then one comes towards you. And so, you change lanes. And wave at the vehicle as it passes by. No sweat. You're still on your way. You know you want to get to the end of this road. To find your destination. Or maybe just a rest-stop. Where you can take a break. Rest. Recuperate. Rejuvenate. And so you keep at it. Move out of the way. This way and that, as more and more vehicles come your way. It gets a little tougher, but you're strong. You can deal with it. You're still on your way. And the longer you keep at it, the bigger the vehicles get. The faster they get. And the quicker they arrive. It feels like a videogame. Only, it is not a videogame. You cannot turn it off and leave. There is no second chance. And so you dodge. Faster. Quicker. This way, and that. You just need to get to the end of the road... This way and that... There is no respite. No break. You're tired now. Your legs hurt. But you are doing all you can. Doing all you can to stay alive. You concentrate. Just a little further and you'll cross this. And there will be time to rest. There is still hope. Bigger, faster, quicker. And you're hurting now. Hungry. Thirsty. Tired. Bruised. Your feet are lead. Your eyes are runny. You are walking, dodging, still moving this way and that. Only barely. Only by instinct. Only because evolution has ingrained in you that indefatigable desire to preserve yourself. And you start to wonder if this road will ever end. If the vehicles will ever stop coming at you. If you will be able to stop without being run over. If the only way to rest is to stop and be run over... You're battered, bruised, and broken. You're one step away from giving up.

The story is a love-triangle set in Berlin. Franz, a village bumpkin, goes to Berlin to work in the department-store of his rich eccentric uncle Dreyer. He has an affair with Martha - Dreyer's wife (his aunt). They begin plotting the murder of their rich uncle - the only obstacle in the way of them being together. But things don't quite go as planned... Per se, the plot of the story is not brilliant or unique. However, where Nabokov excels (as he has done in all his books I have read so far) is in the treatment of the plot and the progress and development of the characters. The characters, and the plot are banal yet interesting, horrible yet charming. Franz is a relatively simple provincial person in more ways than one. He is slightly built, and is not very intelligent. Neither has he grand aims and ambitions. But is also is an ungrateful wretch, who cannot stand up for himself. Uncle Dreyer is eccentrically smart, athletic and successful. But he is emotionally limited, quick to judge, unfaithful, and an egoist. Martha is the beautiful, cold wife of a rich man, bored by the dull monotony of life. But she refuses to stop living by the rules which cause the boredom. Her seduction of Franz illustrates this perfectly - for example. She is faintly repulsed by the fact that she feels any sort of attraction for this non-descript nephew of hers, and yet, she knows she must seduce him, out of the sense of a social duty to do so. The conflict is not only external and between the characters, but also within them, as they change through the course of the book. Nabokov takes each of the characters on their own journeys throughout the novel, as seen through not only their own eyes, but also those of the other characters. And it is precisely this journey that makes the book a lovely read. The writing style is typical Nabokov. In a word, descriptive. To me, it is reminiscent of Nikolay Gogol. However, it is not bland as Gogol sometimes can be. The prose is lyrical, wordplay clever, the metaphors and similes, quite brilliantly precise. Nabokov has a brilliant mind, and it shows. He knows exactly how to paint a picture he wants you to see, and immerse you in it to the point where even the most obvious of twists can take you by surprise. Transitions from feelings to tangible objects and vice-versa are effortless and natural. The opening sequence of the train leaving the platform is one of the loveliest examples of this. The huge black clock hand is still at rest but is on the point of making its once-a-minute gesture; that resilient jolt will set a whole world in motion. The clock face will slowly turn away, full of despair, contempt, and boredom, as one by one the iron pillars will start walking past, bearing away the vault of the station like bland atlantes; the platform will begin to move past, carrying off on an unknown journey cigarette butts, used tickets, flecks of sunlight and spittle; a luggage handcart will glide by, its wheels motionless; it will be followed by a news stall hung with seductive magazine covers-photographs of naked, pearl-gray beauties; and people, people, people on the moving platforms, themselves moving their feet, yet standing still, striding forward, yet retreating as in an agonizing dream full of incredible effort, nausea, a cottony weakness in one's calves, will surge back, almost falling supine. I like to compare it with deep-sea diving. To see the beautiful corals, you have to be willing to immerse yourself in the sea. You will have to get used to the sea, so you can be comfortable. But the effort is worth it, for once you dive in, the diverse beauty of the multitudinous coral reefs in the sea will wow you. This is, of course, usual for most of Nabokov's novels. So, if you have recently read Nabokov, if you don't like his (or in general, a too descriptive) writing style; you might find this book frivolous, or even boring. If you go looking for a complicated story, you might be disappointed. But for me, this was precisely what I enjoyed - the plot did not take away from the genius of Nabokov's writing. In summary, the book is a demonstration of his prowess in engaging the reader, in that there's plenty to admire, plenty to keep the reader interested and engrossed. The plot takes a backstage to the form and style of writing, but KQK is one of those books where you do not mind the destination because you enjoy the journey so much.","tags":"Reviews","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-king-queen-knave-nabokov","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/book-review-king-queen-knave-nabokov"},{"title":"Reasonable...","text":"His feet pounded the pavement. And thoughts pounded away at his head. Age and stress had caught up with him, and exercise had been advised. So, he had started running. After all, he had a long way to go - many responsibilities to fulfil. Keeping fit was the reasonable thing to do. Reasonable. It was a word that defined him. It was the word that had defined his life. In school, he found he had a way with words. He dreamt of being a writer. But a writer's life was not predictable. It did not guarantee a well-paying, respectable job, said the parents. He had to be reasonable about this, they told him. He enrolled to become an engineer. It was the reasonable thing to do. There he found that buildings fascinated him. He decided he would open his own design firm when he graduated. But it was risky, everyone said. Surely, any reasonable person would not undertake a risky venture like that? And he was a reasonable person. So, he applied for that government job instead. He fell in love. Parents were not convinced. He wanted to try and convince them. Then he wanted to run away with her and start a new life - just the two of them. Don't be foolish, she said. Life doesn't work that way. He must let this go - he'll get over the heartbreak, she told him. It had to end. They must not talk anymore - it was not the right thing to do, she said. And so he let it go - let her go. After all, she was being reasonable. He didn't want to marry any more. It wouldn't be fair to his partner, he thought. Parents told him that was stupid. He couldn't possibly spend all his life alone, they said. He'd learn to love the girl he married. He should not wait too long - because he'd be too old then. Be reasonable, they said. And so, he married a girl they chose. And now, forty reasonable years later, he had a reasonably successful marriage, a comfortable life, and a decent social standing. His friends thought he was a wonderful person. He was the model son of his proud parents. To any reasonable person, he was successful. He had no reason to be anything but happy. And there he was. Running. And he wanted to keep running. He wanted to run away from it all. But he was reasonable. And tired. He turned the corner, on the road towards home.","tags":"Scribbles","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/reasonable","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/reasonable"},{"title":"Because","text":"\"I love you.\" She said what she always did, before she hung up. Today, he paused, and cast his mind back to the last time he asked her the question that was now poised on the tip of his tongue. \"Why?\" He thought. There was nothing to suggest he was anything but ordinary. There never had been. He had been the shy, reticent, socially awkward person for as long as he could remember. He was never hugely popular. He had an average education, an average career, average looks, and average success in life. On the other hand, he had disappointed her. Consistently. He chose to work in the field she didnt care much for. He chose to stay away from her for his career. He chose paths different from the ones she advocated, only because she advocated them. And yet, she had always loved him. He ran his hands over the empty space on his bed. He smiled as he recalled a fragment of a different memory, a different time... \"Why do you love me?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I'm short. I'm not good looking... I am...\" \"...Yes, and neither are you smart, or rich, or particularly bright...\" \"Well?\" ... And he knew then why the answer to the question he was about to ask, would be the exact, same one-word answer that he had given to end that conversation, then. There is no reason to love. There is no reason why you feel the way you do. There doesn't need to be. There are no explanations. You can fight, you can cry, you can disagree. But you still love. You accept. There is no need for validation. No reason to pretend. No quid-pro-quo. You just love, because loving someone makes you happy. It is a blind, selfish emotion. You just love... \"Because.\" ... And he knew, he would love her, forever, and always. No matter what. ... And that is why, he also knew, he would not ask the question that he was about to ask now. \"I love you too, mom.\" , he smiled, before he hung up.","tags":"Scribbles","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/love-because","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/love-because"},{"title":"Being OK","text":"He was okay. He had been like that for a while. Sure, life could've been better. But it could've been worse. He counted his blessings and thought, he was okay. Comfortable. Content. Maybe even happy. And then he met her. He wasn't much for talking. Putting himself out there was something he was just beginning to learn once again. But with her, he talked. He didn't realize when courtesy-conversations changed to \"friendly\" ones. In her he found an intellectual companion, an equal. And he talked. About feelings. About life. About his little joys, and disappointments. About his biggest strengths, and weaknesses. He said things only a few ears had heard before. And he wondered. He wondered about how easy it was, how effortless, to open up to her. He wondered because it was strange. He had always been quiet. And all his earlier experiences had taught him the dangers of \"giving people access\". He had been hurt before. He was careful about not getting hurt again. But with her, he wanted to share. To converse. To be comforted when he was hurt. To comfort her when she was. And so, they talked. He wrote to her. He chatted with her. He called her. And she reciprocated. Conversations stretched on for hours. He was never a phone person. But with her, it was easy. There was laughter, contemplation, angst, and above all, catharsis. And he wondered. He wondered because he had never understood how you could talk to someone for hours on end every day. But here he was, doing exactly that. Every day, he found things to say. The dreaded awkward silences never materialized. And all this when he knew her for what she termed as a mere 30 seconds. So he wondered. He wondered what this was. He wondered because it was strange. He wondered what she thought. She told him this is as far as it would get. There were conditions which prevented anything more, she explained. He listened. He understood. He was just happy to have her to talk to. It was undemanding, it was painfree, and it was simple. It was just - comfortable. And so they talked. He smiled when he saw her number flash on the screen of his cellphone. He smiled when she expressed mock outrage over his ribbing. He smiled when he heard those songs she'd recommend to him every day. He smiled when he found she could trust him enough to share a bit of her life with him. He smiled at how they'd end up talking for another hour after she would say that she should hang up and sleep. He smiled when he allowed himself to think he'd found a friend - the kind that he didn't have a lot of in his life. He smiled, and he hoped. He hoped that it would stay this way. He sometimes wondered how it would be if this would've been allowed to be more than it was. But he had made his peace with the fact that it wasn't. He wasn't going to jeopardize a beautifully blossoming friendship - he had started to allow himself to use that word - for something unattainable. Everything was okay. It could've been better, but it could've been worse. He counted his blessings and thought it was okay. He was happy. Until she told him that he must leave her life. He must leave her life because when she thought of him, it made her smile. Because he was nice, and she couldn't afford that he continued to be nice. Because the reasons that had shaped the relationship to what it was, were now forcing them to become strangers once again. Because the fact that conversation was undemanding was now demanding that the conversations stop. He listened. He understood. He wished her well. But he wondered. He wondered how fair it was that he had to let something beautiful go only because it was developing into something more beautiful. That he had to now work harder to shut out those awesome 30 seconds because they were awesome. He wondered if things are not perfect simply because their perfection would be their downfall. Perhaps that was why, the world as it was, was perfect. But all that contemplation, he knew, didn't matter. She demanded he move on. Life demanded he move on. That he be okay again. And he knew he would be. Sure, once in a while, he'd wonder. Wonder what if things would've been different. If he'd been stronger. Wonder how it would've been if she'd been stronger. Wonder if she thinks of him sometimes. Wonder if miraculously their lives would intersect again some day. He'd wonder once in a while. But he knew whatever happened, he'd be okay. He could've been better, but then he could've been worse. He knew he'd count his blessings and think he was okay.","tags":"Scribbles","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/being-ok","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/being-ok"},{"title":"Jump!","text":"Reflecting on my life the last few days, usually left me slightly saddened. It sometimes felt like God is in one of His moods and I'm the ant who is caught under His magnifying glass. The idea of a trip to Mandvi beach was therefore exciting (as all trips to beaches are) and daunting at the same time. When I got there, the usually quiet place was buzzing. It was the 5th day of the Lord Ganesha festival, and the place was flooded with people carrying idols for Visarjan (the auspicious occasion idols of Lord Ganesha are immersed into water). Amidst all the humanity in the midst of festivities and ceremonies bidding Lord Ganesha farewell, amidst all the singing, dancing and colour, amidst those rickety rides, stalls of street food, and men offering you camel rides, was a family... Perhaps the high-point of their day was getting a photographer to capture the family and their Ganesha idols. There was a family photo, and then the photo of their little two year old kid. The kid who wouldn't wear sunglasses. All his mother wanted was for him to wear sunglasses long enough to take a photo. And all that this little guy wanted was to take them off. And between bouts of laughter, exasperation, crying and cajoling, the mother's mission was finally accomplished. The whole episode lasted about 10 minutes, but it left me thinking for much longer... These were people for whom that 10 minute period they spent trying to get take a picture of their kid with sunglasses was the only happiness of the day. This was a kid who will perhaps only ever wear sunglasses in a photo. When these people got home, they were perhaps going to worry about where their next meal was going to come from, or how they'll find means to make sure their child got treated for his sickness. And yet, most, with their song and dance, devotion to Lord Ganesha, and 'gulaal' on their faces were, at that time, far away from life's problems. They were just happy to be. Positive. Happy. Alive. Everyone of them - from the guy who went the farthest in the water with the Ganesh idol, to the smiling, toothless, old lady whose only protection against the sun was a broken umbrella and a wet cloth. While I with my digital camera and expensive glares, was lamenting how life had been unfair. Perhaps it was time to take stock - and be grateful. Maybe God hasn't been so unfair on me after all. He's been good to me. And while I may be His guinea pig sometimes, it's only because He gives me special attention. I don't joke with people I don't feel connected to. Perhaps He is the same. It's funny how little things you experience change how you view the world... Lord Ganesha is the deity we traditionally pray to before we embark on anything new. And here I was, surrounded my SO MANY idols of Lord Ganesha... realizing how fortunate I was... Perhaps, this IS a sign. It IS time. For new beginnings. For a new outlook. For a stronger belief. Perhaps it is time to take the leap... the leap of faith...","tags":"Personal","url":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/jump","loc":"https://pawanrajs.com/posts/jump"}]};
