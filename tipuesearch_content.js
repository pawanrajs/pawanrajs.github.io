In a traditional setup, a request recieved by the web-server (like NGINX) is forwarded to the Content Management System (CMS, like Wordpress). The CMS uses a number of templates, and data from a site database to build an HTML page specific to the request, and return to the user. This allows specifying dynamic behaviours based on user inputs. A static site, by contrast, is a combination of HTML, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript (for dynamic behaviour on the client), stored as simple files and served directly by a web-server or content delivery network. So why build static sites? Low Complexity aka I don't know much Traditional CMS based webhosting requires, in addition to a webserver, a CMS to create HTML pages, plugins to provide functionality, knowledge of a coding language, and a database for the CMS. By contrast, a static site is just a collection of HTML pages, JavaScript and CSS on a webserver - way less for my brain to comprehend and be confused by. Low Cost aka I am cheap Services like S3 or GitHub Pages make hosting costs practically free for low traffic sites (besides the cost of buying a domain). I chose Github Pages for my site, which means no money spent to serve the three people who visit my site. Maintainability aka I am lazy The content of a static website is stored as a collection of marked up text files. This means backups are as easy as a source-control system (yay Github!). Updating the content is as simple as firing up a text editor. Bulk changes and searches within the content are easy to implement. And it is easy to convert from markdown to a different format if desired. All this in addition to avoiding maintenance of the database, CMS and server. Security aka I am paranoid Every out of date plugin, (esp. third party plugins), unpatched database and server is a potential attack surface . Code that I write is probably only going to increase points of infiltration. And I don't want your data, or my data exposed to the world. Speed aka I am impatient Serving a static site is extremely fast because all the web server needs to do is return a file. Site optimization (minification, image optimizations etc) can be performed before deploying, to further reduce bandwidth needs (something I will explore later in the series). A CMS must build pages from scratch using content from the database. Plugins add additional time to this operation. A Project aka I want to be cool I was looking for a project to combine a bunch of concepts which I think I will need going forward, and having a website that I can futz around with to be cool seemed like fun. Okay, okay.. So what now? Well, what we will use is a Static Site Generator (SSG) to do this for us. A SSG is an environment / platform that combines content written in a markup language (e.g Markdown) with pre-created templates (written utilizing a templating engine like Jinja), to produce HTML that you can serve on your site. SSGs are an alternative to the traditional CMS in that once you build the scaffolding that is the theme of your site - all you worry about is the content. Popular static site generators include Jekyll (Ruby) , Pelican (Python) , Hugo (Go) and Metalsmith (JS) â€” see StaticGen for many more options. For our purposes, we will use Pelican because: 1. It is written in Python which I wanted to get more familiar with. 2. It uses Jinja2 for templating - which I am at least vaguely aware of how to use. 3. It supports content written in Markdown which I use to write content. 4. There are plenty of A Word of Caution Static site generators may seem like a perfect compromise between the complexity of a CMS and the drudgery of a hand-coded static site, but it is not for everyone. If you are NOT technically minded, do not have or wish to gain ANY development expertise, hate Command Line Interface, and can't be bothered to trawl through StackOverflow while hating yourself for why a specific plugin doesn't work or why your site won't deploy or page won't render - perhaps you are better off with a Wordpress kind of setup. Me - I chose to do this because I liked the challenge (and possibly because I hate myself) and wanted to work my long disused technical muscle. It gave me a chance to learn a few new tricks and refresh some old ones. Your mileage may vary. Not to mention: a static site does not have server-side functions (forms, comments, logins). There are implementations for comments, search etc, but with limitations. Large websites, with teams of people working on a single update may not jive well with static websites, and the last thing you want to do is hack together a sort of a CMS that you then have to maintain. So choose your poison carefully. That being said - let's get cracking! In the next part we will start with installing Pelican, and setting up for the fun stuff!","tags":"Technology","url":"/posts/static-site-pelican-what-is-going-on","loc":"/posts/static-site-pelican-what-is-going-on"},{"title":"Oooh Shiny!","text":"\"Hello again.\" \"Hello to you, too!\" \"What's on your mind today?\" \"On my mind?

You do not know what it is. You cannot pinpoint it. You try to turn the dial to bring into sharp focus the spectrum of emotions so you can hear them clearly - but find only vague incoherent static. The tuning mechanism of your life-radio is broken; you cannot tune out the static. It's not a sharp pain. It's a dull, undefined general feeling of malaise and unease. It's not isolated or diagnosed to a particular cause. It's just there - pervading your general life experience. Like that persistent irritation which will not go away no matter how many times you clear your throat. Like that headache which doesn't stop you in your tracks, but doesn't let you ignore it either. So you keep going about your daily routine. And there is no problem as such. But you frown when you wake up in the morning, as you have to make an effort to throw off the covers and drag yourself out of bed. You stare for a few seconds too long, first at the wall as you sit up on the bed trying to will yourself off it, then at the stream of water emerging out of the faucet in the bathroom, avoiding looking at yourself in the mirror when you brush. You don't even really want to brush your teeth, but you do. You forego the shave, however - that one day old black stubble is like ... glitter. It's there, betraying you to the world if they care to look closely. You iron your shirt, but not your trousers. Your shoes stay unpolished. It's just not a day for shiny shoes. Not today. You walk to work, but take a longer route. If someone saw you, they would see a man alternatively staring off into the distance, and intently staring at the asphalt he is walking on, almost like he is counting the number of cracks on the road. You linger around at the cart serving coffee outside your office building - staring at the wisps of white smoke emerging out of the blackness of the liquid, but unlike other days - you do not smell the coffee. It is not the day for such pleasures. Not today. You walk up to your office, passing by the usual hordes of office-humanity - trying to tune out the static that is a confusion of spoken words, sighs patient and impatient, clacking shoes, dinging elevators and ringing telephones. Today everything is a little blurred. The whites are a little more yellow than white, the greys are a tiny bit greyer than usual. Your smile at the receptionist is a tiny bit colder. Your response to your boss' greeting is a tiny bit delayed, as he catches up to you on the way to elevator. You are a tiny bit miffed that you would be forced to share the elevator with another person. Just for today, you wanted the 10 second journey up to floor 23 to be in solitude. Maybe, this is good, the small talk is what stops you from falling deeper into the hole, the edge of which you are teetering on. You are miffed anyway. You're not ready for small talk. Not today. You walk past the mahogany door, past the hospital-like sterile sameness of cubicles, the green carpet, the grey cubicles with frosted glass, and the grey frosted people inside. You don't even say good morning to your colleague who looks at you with expectant eyes - wanting - you know - to talk about the incredible football game last night. Not today. Not today. You hurry past it all to your own cubicle right in the middle of this row of cubicles. Your special place in the sea of corporate sameness, housing replaceable, expendable faceless, nameless cogs in the machine. They are all the same. Everything is all the same. Different. But same. It is this sameness, isn't it? It this why you feel like a screw that is drilled in ever so slightly off center? A screw that will do the job, but is not just so? Is this what is bothering you? The thought crosses your mind, flitting across the surface like a pond-skater, creating tiny ripples. But you don't pursue it. This thought will have to wait. You cannot give it your attention.

My folks came to visit me, here in the States. While my father had been to the USA before, it was a first for mom. I saw them after a year, so that was nice. We visited a few places, so that was nice too. I got good homecooked food, which I duly stuffed myself with, and put on all those pounds I shed while I was training for the half-marathon (I think you're growing old when the deliciousness of mom's food starts competing with the need to \"watch your weight\"... Not sure how I feel about that). We took a trip together, the three of us, and *that* was really nice... I've been working for a decade now. I've been living independently, by myself, for most of that time. However, all this while, going home, meant going back to a place where there's someone to take care of you.. This time, though, it really felt the other way round. It felt like I had to take care of my folks. I had to be responsible for them. This is not to say that my parents couldn't do anything without me, because really, they are more than capable of taking care of themselves. However, it felt like they depended on me for a lot of things. And honestly, it was a lovely feeling to just be able to take care of the two people who've spent more than half their life, taking care of you. I sure as hell wasn't perfect doing it, and frankly, I think there's a lot of things I could do better (perhaps a post for another day). But it felt nice to finally be able to repay, even if in an infinitesimally small way, that kindness my parents have showered on me. It felt great to realize that you are someone who is capable and willing enough to do that. I felt like I had finally grown up. So, thank you mom, dad, for being who you were and are. I love you.

Apparently, Facebook played around with newsfeeds to make them more positive / negative. They were trying to determine if mood of the timeline affects the mood of the user. Evidently it does. Predictably, the pitchforks have come out at the supposed audacity of Facebook to manipulate people like that. I am not completely sure what I feel about it, because I haven't really given it a whole lot of thought. But there are a lot of different aspects to this story, that I am not sure how to reconcile... Besides, thinking takes time, which I have limited of. And it's not like you pay me for high-quality journalism. So, dear reader, I am just going to subject you to a laundry list of the initial unstructured mess that is my brain, on the subject: I am scared... Are we really sheeple, people? Does the mood of a series of posts on Facebook really cause our mood to be changed? Are we THAT easily manipulated? As a corollary, how much misplaced confidence do we have in ourselves, that we walk through life thinking that we are immune to the ways of the world, when all it takes to influence us are a few written words on the screen? How does this help Facebook? Will Facebook try now, to be \"your happy place\" ? Is Facebook's business model going to be to keep you happy, so that you keep coming back. I wrote a post, earlier, on the \"Like\" button . Is that just an extension of the \"keep people happy\" philosophy? Will this philosophy work for Facebook? Or is it going to backfire for them, spectacularly? At what point will the constant stream of \"happiness\" attributed to others, start making us jealous and negative instead of happy, as intended, so we \"flip the tables\" so to speak, and never return to Facebook again? Are we increasingly becoming swathes of data, in the eyes of these companies that have our personal information? At what point is the company obligated (if at all) to view us as human beings, and consider that manipulation of our feelings is not \"just another experiment\" ? On the other hand, what cause do we have for outrage? Facebook never promised that we will see the truth. They provide us one way to view our relationships and they've never said it is the truth. Besides, A/B testing is a reality for most internet companies. Isn't this just another form of A/B testing? Why, then, do we expect to be told about it? If Facebook as a service, has a goal of seeing us happy, then isn't Facebook within its rights to make changes to it's \"product\" to gauge customer reaction? Do we have a right to demand that we be told about it? What is the unwritten set of expectations that Facebook is fulfilling, and that we expect them to fulfil? At what point do the \"ethics of humankind\" supercede the \"nature of Facebook's business\"? Are people just angry because we're scared of how easily we are manipulated? Do we see this as an invasion of privacy (which I don't think it is)? Are we just mad at Facebook because we don't like being guinea pigs without knowing about it? Does it warrant this amount of outrage? We don't really think of all the ramifications of giving up our personal data and information to services as long as we get some value out of it. Every new shiny feature on Google of Facebook comes at the cost of our information. Privacy, in this day and age, is just dead. Why then, should it matter at all what Facebook does? Is this indicative of the general distrust of Facebook vis-a-vis other large tech companies? I mean, I doubt there would've been such a big hue-and-cry if Google had done this... If this is indeed how Facebook can influence us, how much about our relationships is defined by Facebook? If Facebook doesn't show me status updates by certain people or businesses, how does that impact my actual relationship with them? Do I forget about some people because I never see updates? If so, how much power does Facebook really have over not only individuals, but also groups and indeed, corporations (by dint of wielding this power over individuals)? I think I'm a little bemused, and quite a bit scared... What do you think?","tags":"Technology","url":"/posts/the-facebook-experiment","loc":"/posts/the-facebook-experiment"},{"title":"To Like or Not to Like...","text":"I've been getting back on to social media after a fairly long hiatus. And most social media services have changed a little bit in that time. What hasn't changed however, is how stuff get's shared around these places. Google has +1, Tumblr has \"reblogging\", Twitter has \"retweet\" and Facebook has the \"like\"... And they rely on these nifty sharing mechanisms to decide what you see.. what bubbles to the top, so to speak. Out of the four, however, only Facebook has something that is a known word with a known meaning. And that makes things interesting... Linguistically speaking, liking something is to inherently tag it as \"good\". In Facebook's context therefore, there's likely to be a cognitive bias towards \"liking\" only stuff that is actually worth liking. That means, that status update someone made about cancer, or losing a loved one, or losing their dog isn't going to get \"likes\" . and is therefore not really going to be on your timeline for a long time. On other platforms, it's easier for those kind of things to bubble up, A +1, or a reblog isn't as \"emotional\" ... I wonder which is better? Personally, I think a true representation of what your friends are interested in is served by something like +1, or \"Share\" or \"Retweet\" or \"Reblog\" because it doesn't have a positive or negative connotation attached to it. It just indicates your \"support\" toward the content. With like , however, you're likely to not get a balanced picture. Is this a flaw, then, on Facebook's part? Did they miss an opportunity to be \"truer\" to the world? Or is \"like\" by design and they WANT only other people's happiness to show through in your timelines, because they know that's what we want to see? Is Facebook banking on the fact that a lot of us are voyeurs who live through others - either sharing in people's happiness, or being jealous of it.. which is why we keep coming back to Facebook? Or is \"Like\" just such a \"brand\" in itself now, that changing it to \"Share\" or \"Support\" just doesn't make any sense any more?

It is The Bible, but without (most of) the \"religious stuff\". What it does is recount the stories in the Bible in short 10-12 page chapters. And as I read, I realize that as a story, the Bible is quite interesting. And in that, it is not alone. The Quran, at its heart, is a story. The Bhagawad Gita, is just a small part of an epic called the Mahabharata. And most religions are underpinned stories about key figures and their deeds. And that says something about the power of stories. Most of what we remember has a good story behind it. A good movie, a good book, an incident you remember in vivid detail - there's a good story behind it. Want to preach - Tell a story. The best adverts - tell a story. A successful sales proposal - dig a little deeper, and you'll find that it chronicles a journey, draws a picture, tells a story. Customer satisfaction, brand recognition, are all about stories. Have you ever got tips on how to improve your memory? Chances are you've been told to connect disparate elements together with the wackiest story imaginable for the strongest recall. Why? Maybe the human brain likes to fill in the blanks between disparate facts. Maybe connections between neurons are analogous to connections between facts. Maybe it's that and the fact that human brains are the best pattern-recognition machines. If a certain group of \"connected pieces\" in a story are similar to something that we've experienced before, the brain just groups them together and invokes similar feelings to what we've previously experienced, making the feeling stronger. Plain simple facts are forgotten. A story endures. And the best stories reinforce already existing emotional structures, enhance experiences. They need an \"investment\" from the consumer of the story, so they feel a part of it. But as we move towards a world with limited attention spans and overload of stimuli, the window of this \"investment\" becomes shorter and shorter. What we end up with is a world of instant gratification - one that does not allow time to build \"connections\", the one that isn't built to endure. I wonder if the world seems a lot more ephemeral, the pace of change so fast, BECAUSE there is no time to stop and listen to stories. I wonder if life seems \"incomplete\" because we're not part of a story or narrative - living life instead, as a series of transactions. I wonder if the lack of stories is what has caused this to happen. Perhaps, what the world needs, is more connections, in more ways than one.","tags":"Scribbles","url":"/posts/the-power-of-stories","loc":"/posts/the-power-of-stories"},{"title":"I Want to Talk to You...","text":"I want to talk to you.

Michener","text":"The Source by James A. Michener Uses the background of an archaeological dig, to chronicle the rise of religion (specifically Judaism) from prehistory (30000 yrs ago), to the modern state of Israel (till 1960s, when the book was written). Defines the relationship of Judaism, with other derivative religions - Christianity and Islam. The book moves and skips in periods of centuries, Each chapter defines an important period in the history of religion, and is based on the levels uncovered during the dig, by the archaeologists. It chronicles the adventures of the members (descendants) of a single family (of Ur) starting from the first shreds of civilization. It's a long read (1000 pages), but doesn't get boring. Written in simple language, without being too judgmental about anything that happened during the time (Except towards the end, when it turns decidedly pro-Zionist). Each chapter relates modern attitudes (through conversations within the group at the archaeological dig) with the historical perspective and precedent of why the attitude prevails. Michener, while speculating on where the future might hold for Israel and Jews, doesn't burden the book with his judgments, or force them on us, and largely sticks to the relating what happened. While the stories ARE fictional, the book is incredibly well researched insofar as the major events of times are concerned, and the generally accepted narrative of history. If you do not know about Judaism, and it's rise, and the attitudes it signifies, and like reading about the history of Judaism and Christianity, and history in general, give it a whirl, and it won't disappoint. It's a wonderful romp through a large swath of time, and definitely better than reading dry academic records of the time. All you must do, is keep reminding yourself, a lot of it is fiction. Because it is very easy to believe a lot of those stories actually happened! So, if historical fiction and the history of religions interests you (like it does me), I recommend it wholeheartedly. You won't be disappointed, as long as the book is. Just remember, it *is* fiction. Or read it as a collection of tales set in different historical times :) My rating: Beautifully done. 4 of 5 stars","tags":"Reviews","url":"/posts/book-review-the-source-james-michener","loc":"/posts/book-review-the-source-james-michener"},{"title":"Nuclear Power","text":"In the beginning there was just, the word...

There were people who opposed the idea, organized demonstrations, conventions, speeches - you know the drill... And the bomb-makers continued to make bombs... and deploy them... They made them more and more sophisticated, bigger, \"badder\" as the clamour against them increased... There was also this set of people who got nostalgic about the world before nuclear power. Presumably these were the set of people that also got nostalgic about the world before rapid industrialization (when that happened) and longed to go back to the time when the earth was flat. They advocated letting the U-235 disintegrate in peace. There were demonstrations, speeches, conventions and pamphlets. People got confused, divided... And all this while, the bomb-makers made bombs... the reactor-makers made reactors, they won the preeminent science-prizes... And there continued to be demonstrations, pamphlets, speeches, conventions and peace-marches...","tags":"Scribbles","url":"/posts/nuclear-power","loc":"/posts/nuclear-power"},{"title":"This way and That...","text":"So, imagine this. You're walking on this road. Just you. All alone. You cannot turn back. You cannot sit down. You have nowhere else to go. You have nowhere to turn. And so, you must walk the direction you're walking in. And then you see a vehicle coming at you. You move out of the way. As you continue on, you see another. And another. And yet another. And then one comes towards you. And so, you change lanes. And wave at the vehicle as it passes by. No sweat. You're still on your way. You know you want to get to the end of this road. To find your destination. Or maybe just a rest-stop. Where you can take a break. Rest. Recuperate. Rejuvenate. And so you keep at it. Move out of the way. This way and that, as more and more vehicles come your way. It gets a little tougher, but you're strong. You can deal with it. You're still on your way. And the longer you keep at it, the bigger the vehicles get. The faster they get. And the quicker they arrive. It feels like a videogame. Only, it is not a videogame. You cannot turn it off and leave. There is no second chance. And so you dodge. Faster. Quicker. This way, and that. You just need to get to the end of the road... This way and that... There is no respite. No break. You're tired now. Your legs hurt. But you are doing all you can. Doing all you can to stay alive. You concentrate. Just a little further and you'll cross this. And there will be time to rest. There is still hope. Bigger, faster, quicker. And you're hurting now. Hungry. Thirsty. Tired. Bruised. Your feet are lead. Your eyes are runny. You are walking, dodging, still moving this way and that. Only barely. Only by instinct. Only because evolution has ingrained in you that indefatigable desire to preserve yourself. And you start to wonder if this road will ever end. If the vehicles will ever stop coming at you. If you will be able to stop without being run over. If the only way to rest is to stop and be run over... You're battered, bruised, and broken. You're one step away from giving up.

The story is a love-triangle set in Berlin. Franz, a village bumpkin, goes to Berlin to work in the department-store of his rich eccentric uncle Dreyer. He has an affair with Martha - Dreyer's wife (his aunt). They begin plotting the murder of their rich uncle - the only obstacle in the way of them being together. But things don't quite go as planned... Per se, the plot of the story is not brilliant or unique. However, where Nabokov excels (as he has done in all his books I have read so far) is in the treatment of the plot and the progress and development of the characters. The characters, and the plot are banal yet interesting, horrible yet charming. Franz is a relatively simple provincial person in more ways than one. He is slightly built, and is not very intelligent. Neither has he grand aims and ambitions. But is also is an ungrateful wretch, who cannot stand up for himself. Uncle Dreyer is eccentrically smart, athletic and successful. But he is emotionally limited, quick to judge, unfaithful, and an egoist. Martha is the beautiful, cold wife of a rich man, bored by the dull monotony of life. But she refuses to stop living by the rules which cause the boredom. Her seduction of Franz illustrates this perfectly - for example. She is faintly repulsed by the fact that she feels any sort of attraction for this non-descript nephew of hers, and yet, she knows she must seduce him, out of the sense of a social duty to do so. The conflict is not only external and between the characters, but also within them, as they change through the course of the book. Nabokov takes each of the characters on their own journeys throughout the novel, as seen through not only their own eyes, but also those of the other characters. And it is precisely this journey that makes the book a lovely read. The writing style is typical Nabokov. In a word, descriptive. To me, it is reminiscent of Nikolay Gogol. However, it is not bland as Gogol sometimes can be. The prose is lyrical, wordplay clever, the metaphors and similes, quite brilliantly precise. Nabokov has a brilliant mind, and it shows. He knows exactly how to paint a picture he wants you to see, and immerse you in it to the point where even the most obvious of twists can take you by surprise. Transitions from feelings to tangible objects and vice-versa are effortless and natural. The opening sequence of the train leaving the platform is one of the loveliest examples of this. The huge black clock hand is still at rest but is on the point of making its once-a-minute gesture; that resilient jolt will set a whole world in motion. The clock face will slowly turn away, full of despair, contempt, and boredom, as one by one the iron pillars will start walking past, bearing away the vault of the station like bland atlantes; the platform will begin to move past, carrying off on an unknown journey cigarette butts, used tickets, flecks of sunlight and spittle; a luggage handcart will glide by, its wheels motionless; it will be followed by a news stall hung with seductive magazine covers-photographs of naked, pearl-gray beauties; and people, people, people on the moving platforms, themselves moving their feet, yet standing still, striding forward, yet retreating as in an agonizing dream full of incredible effort, nausea, a cottony weakness in one's calves, will surge back, almost falling supine. I like to compare it with deep-sea diving. To see the beautiful corals, you have to be willing to immerse yourself in the sea. You will have to get used to the sea, so you can be comfortable. But the effort is worth it, for once you dive in, the diverse beauty of the multitudinous coral reefs in the sea will wow you. This is, of course, usual for most of Nabokov's novels. So, if you have recently read Nabokov, if you don't like his (or in general, a too descriptive) writing style; you might find this book frivolous, or even boring. If you go looking for a complicated story, you might be disappointed. But for me, this was precisely what I enjoyed - the plot did not take away from the genius of Nabokov's writing. In summary, the book is a demonstration of his prowess in engaging the reader, in that there's plenty to admire, plenty to keep the reader interested and engrossed. The plot takes a backstage to the form and style of writing, but KQK is one of those books where you do not mind the destination because you enjoy the journey so much.","tags":"Reviews","url":"/posts/book-review-king-queen-knave-nabokov","loc":"/posts/book-review-king-queen-knave-nabokov"},{"title":"Reasonable...","text":"His feet pounded the pavement. And thoughts pounded away at his head. Age and stress had caught up with him, and exercise had been advised. So, he had started running. After all, he had a long way to go - many responsibilities to fulfil. Keeping fit was the reasonable thing to do. Reasonable. It was a word that defined him. It was the word that had defined his life. In school, he found he had a way with words. He dreamt of being a writer. But a writer's life was not predictable. It did not guarantee a well-paying, respectable job, said the parents. He had to be reasonable about this, they told him. He enrolled to become an engineer. It was the reasonable thing to do. There he found that buildings fascinated him. He decided he would open his own design firm when he graduated. But it was risky, everyone said. Surely, any reasonable person would not undertake a risky venture like that? And he was a reasonable person. So, he applied for that government job instead. He fell in love. Parents were not convinced. He wanted to try and convince them. Then he wanted to run away with her and start a new life - just the two of them. Don't be foolish, she said. Life doesn't work that way. He must let this go - he'll get over the heartbreak, she told him. It had to end. They must not talk anymore - it was not the right thing to do, she said. And so he let it go - let her go. After all, she was being reasonable. He didn't want to marry any more. It wouldn't be fair to his partner, he thought. Parents told him that was stupid. He couldn't possibly spend all his life alone, they said. He'd learn to love the girl he married. He should not wait too long - because he'd be too old then. Be reasonable, they said. And so, he married a girl they chose. And now, forty reasonable years later, he had a reasonably successful marriage, a comfortable life, and a decent social standing. His friends thought he was a wonderful person. He was the model son of his proud parents. To any reasonable person, he was successful. He had no reason to be anything but happy. And there he was. Running. And he wanted to keep running. He wanted to run away from it all. But he was reasonable. And tired. He turned the corner, on the road towards home.","tags":"Scribbles","url":"/posts/reasonable","loc":"/posts/reasonable"},{"title":"Because","text":"\"I love you.\" She said what she always did, before she hung up. Today, he paused, and cast his mind back to the last time he asked her the question that was now poised on the tip of his tongue. \"Why?\" He thought. There was nothing to suggest he was anything but ordinary. There never had been. He had been the shy, reticent, socially awkward person for as long as he could remember. He was never hugely popular. He had an average education, an average career, average looks, and average success in life. On the other hand, he had disappointed her. Consistently. He chose to work in the field she didnt care much for. He chose to stay away from her for his career. He chose paths different from the ones she advocated, only because she advocated them. And yet, she had always loved him. He ran his hands over the empty space on his bed. He smiled as he recalled a fragment of a different memory, a different time... \"Why do you love me?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I'm short. I'm not good looking... I am...\" \"...Yes, and neither are you smart, or rich, or particularly bright...\" \"Well?\" ... And he knew then why the answer to the question he was about to ask, would be the exact, same one-word answer that he had given to end that conversation, then. There is no reason to love. There is no reason why you feel the way you do. There doesn't need to be. There are no explanations. You can fight, you can cry, you can disagree. But you still love. You accept. There is no need for validation. No reason to pretend. No quid-pro-quo. You just love, because loving someone makes you happy. It is a blind, selfish emotion. You just love... \"Because.\" ... And he knew, he would love her, forever, and always. No matter what. ... And that is why, he also knew, he would not ask the question that he was about to ask now. \"I love you too, mom.\" , he smiled, before he hung up.","tags":"Scribbles","url":"/posts/love-because","loc":"/posts/love-because"},{"title":"Being OK","text":"He was okay. He had been like that for a while. Sure, life could've been better. But it could've been worse. He counted his blessings and thought, he was okay. Comfortable. Content. Maybe even happy. And then he met her. He wasn't much for talking. Putting himself out there was something he was just beginning to learn once again. But with her, he talked. He didn't realize when courtesy-conversations changed to \"friendly\" ones. In her he found an intellectual companion, an equal. And he talked. About feelings. About life. About his little joys, and disappointments. About his biggest strengths, and weaknesses. He said things only a few ears had heard before. And he wondered. He wondered about how easy it was, how effortless, to open up to her. He wondered because it was strange. He had always been quiet. And all his earlier experiences had taught him the dangers of \"giving people access\". He had been hurt before. He was careful about not getting hurt again. But with her, he wanted to share. To converse. To be comforted when he was hurt. To comfort her when she was. And so, they talked. He wrote to her. He chatted with her. He called her. And she reciprocated. Conversations stretched on for hours. He was never a phone person. But with her, it was easy. There was laughter, contemplation, angst, and above all, catharsis. And he wondered. He wondered because he had never understood how you could talk to someone for hours on end every day. But here he was, doing exactly that. Every day, he found things to say. The dreaded awkward silences never materialized. And all this when he knew her for what she termed as a mere 30 seconds. So he wondered. He wondered what this was. He wondered because it was strange. He wondered what she thought. She told him this is as far as it would get. There were conditions which prevented anything more, she explained. He listened. He understood. He was just happy to have her to talk to. It was undemanding, it was painfree, and it was simple. It was just - comfortable. And so they talked. He smiled when he saw her number flash on the screen of his cellphone. He smiled when she expressed mock outrage over his ribbing. He smiled when he heard those songs she'd recommend to him every day. He smiled when he found she could trust him enough to share a bit of her life with him. He smiled at how they'd end up talking for another hour after she would say that she should hang up and sleep. He smiled when he allowed himself to think he'd found a friend - the kind that he didn't have a lot of in his life. He smiled, and he hoped. He hoped that it would stay this way. He sometimes wondered how it would be if this would've been allowed to be more than it was. But he had made his peace with the fact that it wasn't. He wasn't going to jeopardize a beautifully blossoming friendship - he had started to allow himself to use that word - for something unattainable. Everything was okay. It could've been better, but it could've been worse. He counted his blessings and thought it was okay. He was happy. Until she told him that he must leave her life. He must leave her life because when she thought of him, it made her smile. Because he was nice, and she couldn't afford that he continued to be nice. Because the reasons that had shaped the relationship to what it was, were now forcing them to become strangers once again. Because the fact that conversation was undemanding was now demanding that the conversations stop. He listened. He understood. He wished her well. But he wondered. He wondered how fair it was that he had to let something beautiful go only because it was developing into something more beautiful. That he had to now work harder to shut out those awesome 30 seconds because they were awesome. He wondered if things are not perfect simply because their perfection would be their downfall. Perhaps that was why, the world as it was, was perfect. But all that contemplation, he knew, didn't matter. She demanded he move on. Life demanded he move on. That he be okay again. And he knew he would be. Sure, once in a while, he'd wonder. Wonder what if things would've been different. If he'd been stronger. Wonder how it would've been if she'd been stronger. Wonder if she thinks of him sometimes. Wonder if miraculously their lives would intersect again some day. He'd wonder once in a while. But he knew whatever happened, he'd be okay. He could've been better, but then he could've been worse. He knew he'd count his blessings and think he was okay.","tags":"Scribbles","url":"/posts/being-ok","loc":"/posts/being-ok"},{"title":"Jump!","text":"Reflecting on my life the last few days, usually left me slightly saddened. It sometimes felt like God is in one of His moods and I'm the ant who is caught under His magnifying glass. The idea of a trip to Mandvi beach was therefore exciting (as all trips to beaches are) and daunting at the same time. When I got there, the usually quiet place was buzzing. It was the 5th day of the Lord Ganesha festival, and the place was flooded with people carrying idols for Visarjan (the auspicious occasion idols of Lord Ganesha are immersed into water). Amidst all the humanity in the midst of festivities and ceremonies bidding Lord Ganesha farewell, amidst all the singing, dancing and colour, amidst those rickety rides, stalls of street food, and men offering you camel rides, was a family... Perhaps the high-point of their day was getting a photographer to capture the family and their Ganesha idols. There was a family photo, and then the photo of their little two year old kid. The kid who wouldn't wear sunglasses. All his mother wanted was for him to wear sunglasses long enough to take a photo. And all that this little guy wanted was to take them off. And between bouts of laughter, exasperation, crying and cajoling, the mother's mission was finally accomplished. The whole episode lasted about 10 minutes, but it left me thinking for much longer... These were people for whom that 10 minute period they spent trying to get take a picture of their kid with sunglasses was the only happiness of the day. This was a kid who will perhaps only ever wear sunglasses in a photo. When these people got home, they were perhaps going to worry about where their next meal was going to come from, or how they'll find means to make sure their child got treated for his sickness. And yet, most, with their song and dance, devotion to Lord Ganesha, and 'gulaal' on their faces were, at that time, far away from life's problems. They were just happy to be. Positive. Happy. Alive. Everyone of them - from the guy who went the farthest in the water with the Ganesh idol, to the smiling, toothless, old lady whose only protection against the sun was a broken umbrella and a wet cloth. While I with my digital camera and expensive glares, was lamenting how life had been unfair. Perhaps it was time to take stock - and be grateful. Maybe God hasn't been so unfair on me after all. He's been good to me. And while I may be His guinea pig sometimes, it's only because He gives me special attention. I don't joke with people I don't feel connected to. Perhaps He is the same. It's funny how little things you experience change how you view the world... Lord Ganesha is the deity we traditionally pray to before we embark on anything new. And here I was, surrounded my SO MANY idols of Lord Ganesha... realizing how fortunate I was... Perhaps, this IS a sign. It IS time. For new beginnings. For a new outlook. For a stronger belief. Perhaps it is time to take the leap... the leap of faith...","tags":"Personal","url":"/posts/jump","loc":"/posts/jump"}]};
