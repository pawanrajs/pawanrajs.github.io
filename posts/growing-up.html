                <p><p>It's been an interesting three months...</p>
<p>My folks came to visit me, here in the States. While my father had been to the USA before, it was a first for mom. I saw them after a year, so that was nice. We visited a few places, so that was nice too. I got good homecooked food, which I duly stuffed myself with, and put on all those pounds I shed while I was training for the half-marathon (I think you're growing old when the deliciousness of mom's food starts competing with the need to "watch your weight"... Not sure how I feel about that).</p>
<p>We took a trip together, the three of us, and <strong>*that*</strong>was really nice... I've been working for a decade now. I've been living independently, by myself, for most of that time. However, all this while, going home, meant going back to a place where there's someone to take care of you..</p>
<p>This time, though, it really felt the other way round. It felt like I had to take care of my folks. I had to be responsible for them. This is not to say that my parents couldn't do anything without me, because really, they are more than capable of taking care of themselves. However, it felt like they depended on me for a lot of things.</p>
<p>And honestly, it was a lovely feeling to just be able to take care of the two people who've spent more than half their life, taking care of you. I sure as hell wasn't perfect doing it, and frankly, I think there's a lot of things I could do better (perhaps a post for another day). But it felt nice to finally be able to repay, even if in an infinitesimally small way, that kindness my parents have showered on me. It felt great to realize that you are someone who is capable and willing enough to do that.</p>
<p>I felt like I had finally grown up.</p>
<p>So, thank you mom, dad, for being who you were and are. I love you. Just so you know, your little boy, is finally growing up..</p></p>
