                <p><p>So, imagine this. You're walking on this road. Just you. All alone. You cannot turn back. You cannot sit down. You have nowhere else to go. You have nowhere to turn. And so, you must walk the direction you're walking in.</p>
<p>And then you see a vehicle coming at you. You move out of the way. As you continue on, you see another. And another. And yet another. And then one comes towards you. And so, you change lanes. And wave at the vehicle as it passes by. No sweat. You're still on your way. You know you want to get to the end of this road. To find your destination. Or maybe just a rest-stop. Where you can take a break. Rest. Recuperate. Rejuvenate.</p>
<p>And so you keep at it. Move out of the way. This way and that, as more and more vehicles come your way. It gets a little tougher, but you're strong. You can deal with it. You're still on your way.</p>
<p>And the longer you keep at it, the bigger the vehicles get. The faster they get. And the quicker they arrive. It feels like a videogame. Only, it is not a videogame. You cannot turn it off and leave. There is no second chance. And so you dodge. Faster. Quicker. This way, and that. You just need to get to the end of the road...</p>
<p>This way and that... There is no respite. No break. You're tired now. Your legs hurt. But you are doing all you can. Doing all you can to stay alive. You concentrate. Just a little further and you'll cross this. And there will be time to rest. There is still hope.</p>
<p>Bigger, faster, quicker. And you're hurting now. Hungry. Thirsty. Tired. Bruised. Your feet are lead. Your eyes are runny. You are walking, dodging, still moving this way and that. Only barely. Only by instinct. Only because evolution has ingrained in you that indefatigable desire to preserve yourself. And you start to wonder if this road will ever end. If the vehicles will ever stop coming at you. If you will be able to stop without being run over. If the only way to rest is to stop and be run over...</p>
<p>You're battered, bruised, and broken. You're one step away from giving up. And you see... the end...</p></p>
